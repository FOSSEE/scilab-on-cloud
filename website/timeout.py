Usage: ./timeout.py TIMEOUT COMMAND...

This is a shell script that runs a command for up to TIMEOUT seconds, sending
the command a SIGKILL once the timeout expires.  If the command exits sooner,
then this script will exit as well.

This functionality is also exposed as a Python module. The TimerTask class
handles running a command in a child process.  There are many modules in the
Python standard library that do this, however.  Here's what's different about
TimerTask:

You can set a timeout such that TimerTask.wait() returns when either 1) the
child process exits naturally or 2) the timeout expires and the child process
receives a specified signal causing it to terminate.  TimerTask.wait() returns
whenever the *sooner* of 1) or 2) happens.

TimerTask uses the SIGALRM signal for its timeout, and so will interfere with
programs that need SIGALRM for other purposes. If you do not specify the use of
a timeout, however, no signal handling will be used.

Finally, the child process is, by default, run in its own process group, to make
it easier to clean up the child process along with any other processes it may
have spawned.
